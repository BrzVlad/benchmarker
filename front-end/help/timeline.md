Select a machine and config to view a timeline of all run sets
from that machine&ndash;config pair. The data point indicates the
normalized average metric&mdash;for example, wall clock
time&mdash;for all benchmarks in that run set. The shaded area
indicates the range (minimum & maximum) of the metric in that
run set. Red data points indicate run sets with one or more crashed
benchmarks.

Clicking a data point will add it to a comparison chart showing
relative results for all benchmarks.
